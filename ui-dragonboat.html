      <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
      <p>With a team of 5 including myself, we were tasked to follow a dragonboat team in Vancouver. By interviewing them, deploying cultural probes, and learning about their lifestyle and work habits, we aim to develop an application that would help them [at that time, unsure of what, but this becomes clear in the later stages of the project].</p>

      <p>Our cultural probes contained short activities that a few memebers of the team can do throughout the week. These activites were short, fun, and nothing too mind-boggling. However, each activity had questions about the individuals lifestyle, work habits, training methods, and morale. This allowed us to piece together a rough idea of who our participants were. We then conducted formal interviews asking about the answers they wrote in the probe. From there, we constructed personas to base our designs around.</p>

        <h3>Tools/Methods used:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
          <li>Adobe Flash</li>
          <li>User Research</li>
          <li>Experience Design</li>
          <li>Cultural probes</li>

      <div class="flex-item-twothird">
        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>I sifted through all the data we collected from our user interviews and cultural probes. I was able to help lay the ground work for our journey framework that the team will be referencing. I was responsible for creating UI sketches as well as wireframe and final prototype using Flash.</p>

       <h3>Project Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>User research including basic interview and fly on the wall observation</li>
          <li>Create Cultural probe used to explore interesting habits/lifestyles of user</li>
          <li>Review and organize data collected from cultural probe. Create Journey Framework [weekly cycle]</li>
          <li>Analyzing data for reoccuring themes and developing ideas based on results</li>
          <li>Created application map and information clusters</li>
          <li>Sketched and created basic wireframes for prototyping and user testing</li>
          <li>Reviewed responses and revised design where necessary</li>
          <li>Final user testing and interviews</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>With a tight deadline for deliverables, we concluded that the team actually needed a shift in staff in order to address some of the issues they had. However, as the second half of our course required us to create a digital application of sorts, we felt that making a team workout log/checklist would help keep the member's training schedule on track.</p>

        <p>Creating a journey framework that was based on our participants helped us understand their work habits, training regime and life-style. Using the information from our user research and cultural probes allowed us to effectively design for the dragonboat team. Although we were not able to fix the problem we identified, we were able to provide an alternate solution. Again, understanding the users and their workflows are extremely important.</p>

        <figcaption>The cultural probe we gave to each of our participants at the beginning of the project consisted of a camera, small sketchbook, and a few questionaires.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>A low fidelity prototype of how we envisioned the home page. Because there were a lot of information, we felt that a tile system would improve scanability.</figcaption>

        <img src="imgs/DragonBoat_prototype_02.png" alt="Dragonboat prototype - individual and team statistic"></img>
        <figcaption>Comparing an individual to the team statistic was an important feature that our participants stressed on. This is another screen depicting how team data might be visualized.</figcaption>

        <img src="imgs/DragonBoat_Final_01.png" alt="Dragonboat final prototype - home page"></img>
        <figcaption>For our final prototype, we eventually moved away from the tile system as it gave the impression that the data was accessible. Splitting the screen also allowed for quick digestion of solo vs team statistics.</figcaption>

        <img src="imgs/DragonBoat_Final_02.png" alt="Dragonboat final prototype - individual and team statistic"></img>
        <figcaption>A final concept for visualizing and understanding team sychronization was the triangulation of how individuals held their paddles and when the paddle blade was fully submerged in the water. This would allow individuals and coaches to see where paddlers were out of sync over time.</figcaption>
