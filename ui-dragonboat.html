      <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
      <p>With a team of 5 including myself, we were tasked to follow a dragonboat team in Vancouver. By interviewing them, deploying cultural probes, and learning about their lifestyle and work habits, we aim to develop an application that would help them [at that time, unsure of what, but this becomes clear in the later stages of the project].</p>

      <p>Our cultural probes contained short activities that a few memebers of the team can do throughout the week. These activites were short, fun, and nothing too mind-boggling. However, each activity had questions about the individuals lifestyle, work habits, training methods, and morale. This allowed us to piece together a rough idea of who our participants were. We then conducted formal interviews asking about the answers they wrote in the probe. From there, we constructed personas to base our designs around.</p>

      <p>With a tight deadline for deliverables, we concluded that the team actually needed a shift in staff in order to address some of the issues they had. However, as the second half of our course required us to create a digital application of sorts, we felt that making a team workout log/checklist would help keep the member's training schedule on track.</p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>This project had me working both as quality control and developer. I was responsible for creating the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~vwah/HTML%20FILES/folk.html" target="_blank">Axure prototype</a> as well as ensuring that all the componets [graphics, copy, wireframes] blended well together. Prior to the creation of the prototype, I was also responsible for creating wireframe sketches and conducting research interviews with various skateboarders.</p>

      <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>As the dragonboat team was training hard for a competition, having a small group of students follow and interview every member would disrupt their tightly packed schedules, thus only a few members agreed to be team representatives.</p>
