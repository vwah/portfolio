      <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
      <p>Steam, created by Valve Software, is a platform that distributes and manages games to a large community of gamers. Gamers like to be around their own, and so Steam offers a place for people to purchase, trade, and play games. At the time, Steam was just a platform that managed and sold games. Their attempt to connect other gamers through a "Community" page was slapped on and frustrating to use.</p>

      <p>We, a team of five gamers, felt that almost everything that Valve did for Steam was very well done. Except for the Community page. It was hard to use, left no notifications when a message was left on the player profile wall, and made the players felt disconnected when joining custom groups/clans. We aimed to fix this protion of Steam as we felt that connecting with other players online was just as important as managing one's game library.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
          <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
          <li>Rapid Prototyping</li>
          <li>User Research</li>
          <li>User Testing</li>
          <li>Wireframes</li>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>During brainstorming sessions, I would be drawing sketches and wireframes of ideas that we thought would be useful. I was also in charge of creating low fidelity prototype for user testing and conducting surveys/questionaires for user research. I was also responsible for taking notes and pictures during user testing sessions. </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>The result of our design was close to a hit and miss situation. We were headed in the right direction, but ultimately failed to make a complete revamp of the community page for Steam. Without proper or any attempt at user research, our redesign might have looked into a different part of the Steam Application. Although we certainly did not ask the right questions, we were right in asking gamers alike what their experience was with Steam and what they liked/disliked about it. This project taught me to frame the question differently so that we as designers, get pass the surface of what users want, and get to the core of what users need.</p>
