        <li>Awareness of current trends in web and user interface design</li>
        <li>Able to synthesize new information and feedback in order to distill it to the most critical issues and draw accurate conclusions</li>

        <li>Fluent in a prototyping software</li>
        <li>Strong UI/UX Design knowledge and trends</li>
        <li>A team player that can recieve and give critical feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Personal Brand</h2>
      <h3>Target Audience?</h3>
      <p>Recruiters or managers of the position that I apply to. I will be targetting those who speak and understand the design language.</p>

      <h3>What do they need to know when visiting?</h3>
      <p>Who am I, What I do, and how I do it. Those should be the three most important things [in no particular order] when visiting the website I create</p>

      <h3>Where and how will they access that?</h3>
      <p>When entering the site, they should get a sense of who I am and my personality based on the imagery and colours I use. The content of my work should be well organized and easily a click away from the home page. When launching a project detail page, I should explain the goal of the project, how it was done, issues that came up, and how we tackled those. A scanable list of the programs and tools I used should be available.</p>

      <h3>Unique identity</h3>
      <p>A neutral grey/metallic colour scheme would be nice, but it would not stand out of the crowd. I plan to intertwine my cultural heritage and passion for games with a minimalistic approach. The trick is to balance the three so that one is not over powering the other.<br>
      The identity of games, culture and good UI/UX is still being worked on at the moment.</p>
