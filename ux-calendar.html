        <h2>Interface Design - Calendar Application</h2>
        <h4>A Student Project</h4>
    </article>
    
<!-- Project rundown -->
    <article class="flex-container" id="border-TopBott">
      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p>With a team of 5 including myself, we had to come up with a design that can link families together virtually. We looked to how skype functions and wondered, what is it that most families talk about when they connect virtually? We figured that it was the special moments that happened day-by-day that is captured locally, and viewed virtually over the internet. What we have now is an interactive calendar that links families together through special moments that happen daily. Planit.

        <h3>Tools/Methods used:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
          <li>Adobe Flash Catalyst</li>
          <li>Wireframe sketches</li>
          <li>Heuristic Evaluation</li>

        </ul> 
      </div>      
      <div class="flex-item-twothird">
        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>My role in this project was facilitating design discussions. Moderating these discussions allowed me to practice framing the problem/question differently. By framing, I was able to find edge-cases or new angles for discussion. I also had a lot of fun generating the ideas and communicating them via sketches on the whiteboard or paper. Listing out the values and intetntions of our potential users ensured that our design fit into their daily lives. </p>

       <h3>Project Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Researched on [then] new and upcoming technologies and trends</li>
          <li>Recombined various trends and interactions while catering to project brief</li>
          <li>Constructed wireframes and sought feedback</li>
          <li>Created Flash protoype using Adobe Flash Catalyst</li>
        </ol>
      </div>      
      <h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>Feedback is  about the work, never about the person. As this was a project done early on in my academic career, I learnt that being able to accept constructive feedback, is part of the learning process and that I should embrace it if I am to become a successful designer. However, taking feedback is half the job, giving good feedback is the other, and I've been able to provide encouraging yet constructive feedback to my peers.</p>

      <h3>Project Images</h3>
      <figure>
       <img src="imgs/planit_01.png" alt="Home screen of the Planits idle screen"></img>
        <figcaption>Our vision of what the idle screen would be like for those using the PlanIt application at home. Each household is reprsented by a floating solar system, and the planets that orbits within them are family members residing in that household. Lines are interconnected to show what events are shared amongst other family household that may live in a different city or country.</figcaption>
        <img src="imgs/planit_02.png" alt="Calendar view where users can input their events for the family to see/share"></img>
        <figcaption>The fridge note/calendar helps organizes and notifies the household of important coming events. Replicating this for our PlanIt application as important. This is the homepage for PlanIt when it's not in its idle state. It displays the weekly calendar to the individual, allowing them to quickly scan for upcoming events, or add one if they want. </figcaption>
        <img src="imgs/planit_03.png" alt="Replacing the phonebook."></img>
        <figcaption>Although everyone has a cell phone, the home phone book still contains all the contacts a family needs. PlanIt is a visonary application that replaces the standard home phone that family household had and provides them with a central command center to both organizes, notifies, and connect family members.</figcaption>
