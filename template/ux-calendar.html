        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <h3>Our Thinking</h3>
        <p>Our project goal was to link distant families together by sharing experiences through events and media created by family members. We found that although current technology has allowed us to connect virtually, it has also allowed us to disconnect physically. Let me elaborate on this. We, as users have cellphones or tablets that we keep close to us at all times. The cellphone and tablet, allow us to connect with our friends, families, or co-workers through the means of face-time, texting, calling, and even conference calling with groups. This form of connection is great! It's fantastic! However, we felt that as individuals get virtually connected with others, they get physically disconnected to their immediate family members. Although our idea does not aim to fix that physical barrier, we want to find a way to re-mediate the connection, and what better way to do that than use more technology?</p>

        <p>Of course, there had to be a limit to our vision, and so we decided to focus on trying to help connect distant family members. Before we go on any further, we must define what we mean by distant. We mean distant as any location where one cannot get to (by car) in one day (24 hours). This means that any connection between the two family members would have to be virtual. Because of this limitation, we decided to focus on another core value, sharing an experience. At the time of this project, the prototype for Google Glasses (Video here) was just released and what really struck us was the last bit, sharing a sunset with someone dear, but separated by a huge distance. Capturing and sharing that experience was something we wanted to replicate in our project.</p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, I constantly moderated and encouraged group discussion and debates. As young designers, I feel it is necessary to expose ourselves to ideas coming from people with different backgrounds, thus the open group debates and discussions. By moderating, I made sure that the argument was about the design, not the people. I found that those who stayed silent for too long meant that they were daydreaming, or that they were thinking of something worth sharing. Most of the time it's the latter one, but I still strive to encourage group-members to share their ideas.</p>

        <p>The programs that I used were Adobe Illustrator, Flash, and Catalyst. As this course was an introduction to Interface Design, using Illustrator to create the aesthetics and Flash/Catalyst to create a click-prototype. I was able to continue honing my skills in Illustrator, and to establish the fundamental basics and process of creating a click prototype.

        <p>The idea of "planets orbiting" was suggested by me. Although the initial idea was rough, and vague, it created discussions within the group that eventually lead to some designs that were implemented into our final prototype. Credit goes to everyone in the group for expanding and refining the idea into a visual representation of who we are connected to in our lives. Below were some of the rough sketches that I made for our group during our ideation and development phase.</p>

        <p>Wait a minute, they don't JUST wait. They also get to access a new section that we felt was lacking in any Skateboarding website. A section where local skateboarders or Icons can gather and reinforce their already cohesive community.</p>
      
        <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <p>This project taught me a few lessons that I would take to heart. The first thing I learned was that the functionality of an interface should take precedent over the aesthetics. Let me elaborate on this. I'm not saying that the aesthetics are not important when designing an interface, but the functionality of the interface - particularly how the user navigates through the interface - should be considered over aesthetic appeal. Let me provide you with an example.

        <p>A member in our group strongly believed that the aesthetics of the interface should not change, even after several user-tests revealed that certain aspects of the aesthetic interfered with the user experience. Of course, doing a complete make-over would be too drastic, but after much debate, little of the designs were changed and thus comments on the functionality and usability of our interface were made when we show-cased it to the class. That being said, the aesthetics were consistent and original, which drew praised from the Instructor and Teacher Assistants.</p>

        <p>The second thing I learned from this project was the ability to handle and cool heated discussions and debates. At one point in our project, some team-members took some feedback/critiques a little too personally. Although it was a slight hiccup, I was able to resolve the situation and get the team back on track. This not only exposed me to the different personality in each of us, but allowed me to think quickly on the spot, judge the current situation, and resolve it with timely and tactful actions, while also redirecting the focus back towards the original discussion.</p>
